# FindNearestIceCream
Find's the nearest McDonald's with a working Ice Cream machine.


In use, a McDonald's franchise would register an account on the site and then add their store to the database and state whether or not their ice cream machine is working. Users can then go to the finder page and input their address and then be redirected to the google maps page of the geo coordinates of the closest McDonald's whose Ice Cream machine works.
